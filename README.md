# cypress-image

> Full Docker image for running [Cypress CI][cy] test in your own container

The Docker image is built automatically on any code changes,
and it is hosted on the Docker hub at
[bahmutov/cypress-image/](https://hub.docker.com/r/bahmutov/cypress-image/)

## Tags / versions

We build several tags, based on Node and Cypress version, usually following
the pattern `node-<major>-cypress-<full cypress version>`, for example
`node-6-cypress-0.19.2`.

If you just need a base image with Node and XVFB dependencies Cypress needs
to run, pull `bahmutov/cypress-image:node-6-cypress-deps` or
`bahmutov/cypress-image:node-7-cypress-deps`

If you want to pull an image with dependencies AND specific verson of
Cypress installed globally

* [bahmutov/cypress-image:node-6-cypress-0.19.2](images/node-6-cypress-0.19.2)
  a base image with Cypress 0.19.2 installed globally
* ... other tags, see [images][images] subfolders

[images]: https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-image/tree/master/images

To test if a particular full image is working correctly, run with to print
the Cypress version

```sh
docker run -it bahmutov/cypress-image:node-6-cypress-0.19.2 cypress --version
Cypress CLI: 0.13.1
Cypress App: 0.19.2
```

If you already have a local Docker image, and you would like to download the
official image again, delete the local image and run the command again. To
delete an image

```sh
docker rmi bahmutov/cypress-image:node-6-cypress-0.19.2
```
